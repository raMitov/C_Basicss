    Task: In C, define an array of a struct (e.g. struct Point { int x, y; };). Use a Point* p = array; and demonstrate that p++ moves to the next element (sizeof(Point) bytes ahead). (Concept: pointer arithmetic on structs)

    Task: Using a pointer p to the first element of a struct array, set p->x in a loop using p++. Verify that each struct in the array is modified. (Concept: iterating structs with pointers)
