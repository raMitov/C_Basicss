    Task: Write a C header (utils.h) with a #define macro (e.g. #define SQUARE(x) ((x)*(x))) and a C source file that includes it and uses the macro. (Concept: preprocessor macro expansion)

    Task: Create two C source files: one defines a function (int add(int,int)) and one main() that calls it (with extern declaration). Compile and link them together. (Concept: compiler output and linker combining modules)
