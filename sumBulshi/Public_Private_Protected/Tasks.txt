    Task: Define a C++ class Secret with a private integer and a public setter/getter. Try accessing the private member from main() (should fail) and through the getter (should work). (Concept: public vs private access)

    Task: Create a base class with a protected member, then derive a subclass that reads/writes that member. Show that code outside the class cannot access the protected member, but the subclass can. (Concept: protected access)
