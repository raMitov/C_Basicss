    Task: Define a C++ class with a static int counter and increment it in the constructor. In main(), create multiple instances and print ClassName::counter to show one shared value. (Concept: static member variable)

    Task: Define a class with a mutable int accessCount. In a const method that returns some value, increment accessCount. Show that you can modify accessCount even though the method is const. (Concept: mutable in const context)
