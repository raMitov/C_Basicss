    Task: Write a C++ class Base { /* no virtual destructor */ } and class Derived : public Base. Allocate Derived* d = new Derived; Base* b = d; delete b;. Observe that Derived destructor is not called. (Concept: missing virtual destructor)

    Task: Make Baseâ€™s destructor virtual and repeat the above. Show that now both Derived and Base destructors execute. (Concept: proper cleanup with virtual destructor)
