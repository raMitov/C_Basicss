    Task: Write a C loop that scans an array of 
    integers and stops when it finds the first 
    negative number, then returns its index. 
    (Concept: for loop and break)

    Task: Use a for loop to sum values until 
    a sentinel value (e.g. 0) is encountered, 
    then exit the loop. (Concept: loop control 
    and early exit)
