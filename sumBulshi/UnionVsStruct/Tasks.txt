    Task: Define a C struct with an int and a float, and a union with the same members. In code, assign values to each and print their sizes and contents. (Concept: memory layout of structs vs unions)

    Task: Use a C union of an int and a char[4] to pack an integer into bytes. Write to the int member and then read the char array to examine the byte values. (Concept: union aliasing and shared memory)
